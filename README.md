## Class description

The  goal  of  this  course  is  to  give  the  student  an  introduction  to  the  world  of  robotics  through  a 
series of hands-on constructionist projects as well as individual study, homework, and exams. In 
addition, the student will become familiar with, and demonstrate developed skills in the principal 
subsystems that comprise robotic systems. Those subsystems include:
* Electrical
  * Sensors
  * Microprocessors 
  * Motor drivers
* Mechanical
  * Motors
  * Gears
  * Mechanism design
* Software
  * Flow charting
  * Programming
  * Algorithm development
  * Debugging and testing
* Power
  * Power storage
  * Power monitoring and utilization

Students will participate in a series of design projects in which they build and program robots to 
perform specific tasks. A variety of sensors (e.g., contact sensors, optical encoders, IR rangers, 
photo  detectors,  IR  communication  sensors,)  will  be  characterized,  wired  and  then  integrated 
into the robot to provide environmental and pro-perceptive sensing.

### Labs
1. Motor performance characterization
2. Dead reckoning navigation (open loop control)
3. Reactive control
4. Obstacle avoidance and maze navigation
5. Maze solving (learning a direct path to the goal)
6. Open-ended design project

## Code descriptions
For the most part code descriptions can be found in the commits and descriptions for them. Additionally, in all code
written, we did our best to add comments where we did something a little fishy. 

Most of the code written is based on the MotorControl library we wrote (included in most labs with the version of the library 
that was run). In order for this to work on your personal environment, you will need this library downloaded and in the same folder.

## Lab reports
Source latex code for our lab reports is included as well in the `Lab Reports` folder.
